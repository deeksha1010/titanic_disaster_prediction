# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
This project predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using a Random Forest model 🌲. The dataset is from Kaggle's Titanic competition, a great beginner project for learning machine learning 🤖.

## Project Overview
The goal is to predict if a passenger survived based on features like age, gender, class, etc. 👤🛳️ I used a Random Forest classifier to make these predictions.

## Results
Used Random Forest 🌲 to achieve the results. The key factors in predicting survival were gender, passenger class, and fare 🎫.

## Conclusion
Random Forest worked well for predicting Titanic survival 🚢👍.
